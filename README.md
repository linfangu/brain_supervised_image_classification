## Projects at Cajal's Neuro-AI course 

### Project 1 - brain supervised image classification.

In the project, we explored the image classification performance of Alexnet, and used human brain activity to improve performance and supervise training. 
Results:
1. Alexnet layers align with the functional hierarchy of the visual regions of the brain
2. Adding fMRI data of specialized brain regions (body/face selective regions), but not early visual areas, improves classification performance of Alexnet 
3. To integrate the additional features of the brain into Alexnet (and therefore not taking neural signals as inputs), we designed a dual loss training on the Alexnet to predict image labels and neural signals at the same time.  

### Project 2 - low dimensional neural representation of the fruit fly simulated embodyment 

In this project, we took the simulated fruit fly embodiment and explored the representation of actions in its neural network. 
Results:
1. Clustered network activity controls the simulated fruit fly
2. Ablated clusters can be recovered by low rank representation by taking average of the cluster
